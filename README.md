# Predicting Wilson's Disease Using Synthetic Medical Data

### üåü **Overview**
This project is an end-to-end machine learning workflow designed to predict **Wilson's Disease**, a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver and other organs. Due to the scarcity of real-world datasets for rare diseases, a **synthetic dataset** was created to replicate realistic medical scenarios, including patient profiles with liver-related conditions. 

This repository provides an excellent example of tackling medical data challenges, such as:
- Working with **imbalanced datasets**.
- Handling **missing values** for crucial biochemical indicators.
- Engineering features for better predictive performance.
- Evaluating models with an emphasis on **sensitivity and specificity**‚Äîcritical for medical use cases.

### üìä **Dataset**
The dataset simulates patient data, including key medical indicators such as liver function tests, biochemical markers, and demographic attributes. 

Key details:
- It includes cases of various liver diseases, with a specific focus on **Wilson's Disease**.
- Features are engineered to reflect real-world medical patterns.
- Missing values were introduced intentionally to mimic challenges often faced in clinical datasets.
